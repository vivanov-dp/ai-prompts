## Plan a task

Consider the following task:

....

Write a structured plan to perform the task in a .md file in the `tasks/` folder.
The file should contain a list of logically ordered tasks, grouped into stages for implementation.
Every stage should have a number and contain no more than a few tasks that can be logically done as a unit.
It is ok the plan to contain only one stage if it's small enough.
There should be a placeholder checkbox before each task, to be checked off when completed.

## Execute stage of planned task

Perform the tasks listed under Stage 1 in `tasks/hosts-plan.md` and mark them as done
