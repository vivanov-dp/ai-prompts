## Plan a task

Consider the following task:

....

Write a structured plan to perform the task in a .md file in the `tasks/` folder.
The file should contain a list of logically ordered tasks, grouped into stages for implementation.
Every stage should have a number and contain no more than a few tasks that can be logically done as a unit.
It is ok the plan to contain only one stage if it's small enough.
There should be a placeholder checkbox before each task, to be checked off when completed.

## Execute stage of planned task

Analyze the tasks plan in `tasks/auth-login.md` and consider context stored there if any.
Perform the tasks listed under Stage 1 in the plan and mark them as done.
Preserve context by adding it to the end of the plan file, so that you can read it back and continue working on the tasks in the future.
